# Button Blink
Philip Quinn: Utilizes a loop to constantly check whether a signal from a button is being sent. When it is detected, the LED will get turned on. All 5 boards had this code specifically implemented.
## Extra Work
Utilizing the MSP430G2553, a color change between two LEDs was implemented. Both the green and red LEDs can be toggled using the same button.
