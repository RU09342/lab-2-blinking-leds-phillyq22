# Off Board Blink
Philip Quinn: The Simple Blink portion of this lab was performed off board, utilizing the MSP430G2553. A 10uF bulk capacitor and 100pF bypass capacitor were connected in parallel with the chip. The reset circuit consists of a button in parallel with a 100pF capacitor connected between the reset pin and ground. The LED circuit connects P1.0 to ground, in series with a 100ohm resistor to limit the current. The power source is a 3.3V power supply. Video of the circuit is attatched above.
